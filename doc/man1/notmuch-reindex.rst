SYNOPSIS
========

**notmuch** **reindex** [*option* ...] <*search-term*> ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Re-index all messages matching the search terms.

See **notmuch-search-terms(7)** for details of the supported syntax for
<*search-term*\ >.

The **reindex** command searches for all messages matching the
supplied search terms, and re-creates the full-text index on these
messages using the supplied options.

Supported options for **reindex** include

    ``--decrypt=(true|nostash|auto|false)``

        If ``true``, when encountering an encrypted message, try to
        decrypt it while reindexing, stashing any session keys
        discovered.  If ``auto``, and notmuch already knows about a
        session key for the message, it will try decrypting using that
        session key but will not try to access the user's secret keys.
        If decryption is successful, index the cleartext itself.

        ``nostash`` is the same as ``true`` except that it will not
        stash newly-discovered session keys in the database.

        If ``false``, notmuch reindex will also delete any stashed
        session keys for all messages matching the search terms.

        Be aware that the index is likely sufficient (and a stashed
        session key is certainly sufficient) to reconstruct the
        cleartext of the message itself, so please ensure that the
        notmuch message index is adequately protected. DO NOT USE
        ``--decrypt=true`` or ``--decrypt=nostash`` without
        considering the security of your index.

        See also ``index.decrypt`` in **notmuch-config(1)**.
